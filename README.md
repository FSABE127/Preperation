# 🚀 OSWE + OSCP Preparation Journey

Welcome to my **HackTheBox Preparation Repository**.  
This repo documents my **daily practice and writeups** as I prepare for:

- **OSWE (Offensive Security Web Expert)** → Web application exploitation & advanced code review  
- **OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional)** → General penetration testing with focus on AD, privilege escalation, pivoting  

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Solve **1 OSWE-like machine + 1 OSCP-like machine per day**  
- Document each box in structured `writeup.md` format  
- Track progress (flags captured, techniques learned, mistakes avoided)  
- Build a personal methodology for exam-style reporting  

---


---

## 📅 Daily Routine
- [x] Pick **1 OSWE machine** from the [OSWE order list](./OSWE)  
- [x] Pick **1 OSCP machine** from the [OSCP order list](./OSCP)  
- [x] Work through machine → document in `writeup.md`  
- [x] Capture user + root/admin flags  
- [x] Add lessons learned to cheatsheets

## 📊 Progress Tracking
| Day | OSWE Machine | Status | OSCP Machine | Status |
|-----|--------------|--------|--------------|--------|
| 01  | Blocky       | ✅ Done | Access       | ✅ Done |
| 02  | Popcorn      | ✅ Done | Help         | ⏳ In Progress |
| 03  | Celestial    | ⏳ In Progress | Networked   | ⏳ In Progress |
| ... | ...          | ...    | ...          | ...    |

✅ = Completed | ⏳ = In Progress | ❌ = Skipped

## 🔑 Methodology
1. **Enumeration First** → Services, ports, directories, code review  
2. **Exploit Development** → Custom payloads, PoC refinement  
3. **Privilege Escalation** → Kernel exploits, misconfigs, weak permissions  
4. **Report Writing** → Document step-by-step like exam conditions  
5. **Reflection** → Lessons learned → Update cheatsheets

## 🏆 End Goal
- Finish **all OSWE-like & OSCP-like machines** (≈ 50+ boxes)  
- Be exam-ready with strong documentation skills  
- Build a **personal pentest methodology repo** to use during certifications and real-world work
